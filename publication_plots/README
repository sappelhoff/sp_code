In this directory we will collect the publication plots.

Running the analysis notebooks will save CSV files in here.

Running `../publication_plots.ipynb` will save PDF files in here.

`fig1a.odg` can be used to export `fig1a.pdf` (via LibreOffice Draw).

The corresponding `fig1bcd.pdf` file will be produced when running `../publication_plots.ipynb`.

PDFs should be cropped using the `pdfcrop` command line tool that is shipped via the TeX Live distribution (https://www.tug.org/texlive/).

`fig1-tikz.tex` can be used to merge `fig1a-crop.pdf` and `fig1bcd-crop.pdf` into a single `fig1.pdf` file (via XeTex; most easily accessed via https://www.overleaf.com).

`fig1-tikz_to_png.sh` can be used to convert `fig1.pdf` to PNG format.
